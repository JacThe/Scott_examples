# Linear Model Exploration
Based on *Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats)*

- [R Version](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/)
- [Python Version](https://eigenfoo.xyz/tests-as-linear/)

Also based on [this resource](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faq-how-do-i-interpret-odds-ratios-in-logistic-regression/) from UCLA explaining the interpretation of logistic regression.

### Important: R Setup
To use the conda R kernel inside of Jupyter, activate the conda environment by running `conda activate linear_models`. Then enable the R kernel by running `R -e 'IRkernel::installspec()'`. Afterward you are free to run `jupyter-lab` or `jupyter-notebook`.
